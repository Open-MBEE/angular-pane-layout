@openmbee/pane-layout
====================

A set of Angular.js 1.8 components written in Typescript to manage and define border layouts. This is intended as
a bridging system to enable users to migrate existing implementations over to TS/Angular 2.x. In that spirit, aspects of 
the library have been re-written to leverage RxJS and UI-Router 1.x opposed to their built in AngularJS counterparts.

A future version of this library will be made compatible, with Angular 2.x.
